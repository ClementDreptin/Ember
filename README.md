# Ember

Ember is a game engine written in C++ based on [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno)'s 
game engine: [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).
I haven't implented any of my own features yet, I'm just following the tutorials available 
in a [playlist on his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT). 
I'll try to make my own features in the future.
